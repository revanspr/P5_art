### 1. Golden Ratio Spiral
**Directory:** `golden-ratio-spiral/`

An animated visualization that plots the golden ratio relationship between whole numbers (a = 1 to 100) and their halves (b = a/2). The visualization creates a spiral pattern using the golden ratio, with points plotted every 0.02 seconds. Colors transition through the rainbow spectrum, changing every 10 calculations while previous colors continue from the origin.

**Features:**
- Animated plotting at 0.02 second intervals
- Rainbow color progression (10 colors total)
- Real-time display of current a and b values
- Golden ratio spiral pattern
